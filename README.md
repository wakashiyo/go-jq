# go-jq

It is a command line tool that can get the value etc. that you want from json with a query like jq.

## Description

This is based on [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), a lightweight json parser that would be something everyone tried to use on a linux machine.

However, at this time, this tool does not cover everything that jq can do.Currently, this tool can be used on json files. (Not available for json strings.)

All you can do is extract the value you want from json. The usage is described in the example below, but you can get the value with a query similar to jq.

## Example
